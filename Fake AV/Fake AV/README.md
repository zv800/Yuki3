# Hotlands Antivirus
You may be asking yourself: "wait, Hotlands had an antivirus?" Well yeah, Hotlands had everything!

Yes, it's an Antivirus software made in VB.net. It's good for what it is. It comes with a functioning scanner that does clean whatever malware it may find, a basic text editing tool, and a small database of various malware. It was never finished or released to the public and that probably does show. Maybe you can be the man who finishes it!
